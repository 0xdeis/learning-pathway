Learning how to program $\iff$ learning how to hack.

Before getting into hacking things, you first have to understand how they work.
If you want to hack websites, you first need to understand how they work, then you can begin to find bugs.
Maybe even make a few websites to really see how everything fits together, and then try to break things.


## Fundamentals

### The Shell and Linux

When hacking pretty much anything (online), there are some tools that you end up using a lot. 
It's definitely worth learning these tools in and out, because
 - knowing the capabilities of these tools gives you ideas when hacking
 - learning how they work gives you specific knowledge about the underlying technology

 The terminal (or shell or command line) is the most powerful way to use a tool. 
 Most UIs have to be dumbed down because showing the user 200 buttons, text inputs, and sliders would be way too much information to process and get familiar with.

That's where the command line interface (CLI) comes in.

All CLI tools can do the exact same thing a GUI (graphical user interface) can, they just use text instead of buttons and text boxes. The text-only approach ends up being much faster most of the time, and its much easier to have multiple tools running at the same time.

<!-- For example, if I wanted to rename a file in a GUI, I would open my file explorer, navigate to where the file is, right click on it, and then type the new name into the input box. -->
<!---->
<!-- For the CLI, I would just type -->
<!---->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- mv /path/to/old.txt /path/to/new.txt -->
<!-- # or even -->
<!-- mv old.txt new.txt -->
<!-- ``` -->

The best way to learn how to use the terminal is by using it. There is this fun game based around learning different command line tools called Bandit. I suggest going through the entire thing before moving on to the next section.
